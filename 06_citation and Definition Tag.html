<h1>Tirukkural</h1>
<p>

    The <cite>Tirukkuraá¸·</cite> or shortly the Kural, is a classic Tamil language text consisting of 1,330 short couplets,
    or kurals, of seven words each. The text is divided into three books with aphoristic teachings on virtue,
    wealth and love, respectively. Considered one of the greatest works on ethics and morality, it is known
    for its universality and secular nature. Its authorship is traditionally attributed to Valluvar, also known
    in full as <dfn>Thiruvalluvar.</dfn> The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 5th century CE. The traditional
    accounts describe it as the last work of the third Sangam, but linguistic analysis suggests a later date of
    450 to 500 CE and that it was composed after the Sangam period.
